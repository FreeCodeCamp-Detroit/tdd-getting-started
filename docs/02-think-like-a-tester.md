# Thinking Like a Tester

Have you ever finished one of the Algorithm Challenges on the FreeCodeCamp website, worked through a kata on CodeWars, passed all tests on an exercise on CoderByte, or solved some other coding challenge or toy problem? If not, don’t worry. You will complete your first coding challenge shortly. This first set of questions is for the rest of you. If you have completed a coding challenge, think about the process used to approach the problem. What did you do?

My Process: The Early Days

1. Open my text editor
2. Start writing code. While writing it:
   * Check documentation for helpful Class methods
   * Research regular expressions
   * Keep coding
3. Execute the code
4. Figure out where I went wrong
5. Rewrite the code
6. Continue until I have a working solution

A Test-Driven Process

1. **Understand the Problem** - restate in your own words what the problem is asking of you, even if it seems obvious
2. **Identify Inputs and Outputs** - what are you asked to derive (output) based on the provided information (input)
3. **Run through Examples** - before writing code, write down some example inputs and the correct outputs the solution should provide
4. **Write Some Pseudocode** - using plain language (instead of programming language syntax) write out what your program should do
5. **Consider the Gotchas** - is there any hidden complexity in the problem? Is there something about your planned solution that might cause an issue?
6. **Turn the Inputs, Outputs, Examples, and Gotchas into Tests** 

Let’s Try a Problem Now!

> Find and return the longest word in a string

Instead of going straight to your text editor to write code, take out a notebook or create a text document and write down the following:

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT:
2. INPUTS:
3. OUTPUTS:
4. EXAMPLES:
5. PSEUDOCODE:
6. GOTCHAS:
