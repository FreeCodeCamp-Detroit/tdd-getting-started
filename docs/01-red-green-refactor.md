# Red-Green-Refactor

Red-Green-Refactor describes the cycle of test-driven development:

* **RED:** Write and run a failing test
* **GREEN:** Write the source code necessary to pass the test
* **REFACTOR:** Clean the codebase (without breaking tests)

Repeat!

Exercise

3. Describe in your own words what the test is expecting
4. Run the test: `npm test`
